Day 1 (15/1/2025)

> Promise is an Object

In Day one I tried to solve some question of promise and then i realize i have lots of things to learn in this topic to understand so while i was trying to solve these question some topics are spotted that i look for the first time:

*methods>
1. promise.all() : this method gives you power that can check array of promises are resolved if resolve then it's return a single promise otherwise if any of the promise are reject from array then this will also reject.
